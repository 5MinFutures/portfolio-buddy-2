## Overview

### Context

**Old App:**
- Location: `C:\Users\kg129\Desktop\5MF\Portfolio_Buddy\src\App.tsx`
- Size: ~2800 lines of code
- Architecture: Single monolithic component
- Status: Functional but unmaintainable

**New App:**
- Location: `C:\Users\kg129\Desktop\5MF\Portfolio Buddy 2\`
- Size: ~3500 LOC across 27 files
- Architecture: Component-based, hooks, TypeScript
- Status: Production-ready foundation

### Goal

Migrate features from the old monolithic app to the new modular architecture while:
- Maintaining existing functionality
- Improving code quality
- Following coding standards
- Adding tests as we go
- Documenting decisions

### Success Criteria

- [ ] All features from old app migrated
- [ ] No functionality lost
- [ ] Better performance
- [ ] Better maintainability
- [ ] Proper TypeScript types
- [ ] Error handling throughout
- [ ] Documented code

---

## Old App Analysis

### To Be Completed

**Location:** `C:\Users\kg129\Desktop\5MF\Portfolio_Buddy\src\App.tsx`

**Analysis Tasks:**
1. Read the entire 2800 line file
2. Identify all features
3. Document dependencies
4. Note complex algorithms
5. Find UI components
6. Map state variables
7. Document data flows

**Output:** `dev-docs/old-app-feature-inventory.md` (to be created)

**Script for Analysis:**

```typescript
// Analysis checklist:
// - What features does it have?
// - What libraries does it use?
// - What data structures?
// - What calculations?
// - What UI components?
// - What state management?
// - What are the pain points?
```

- Code splitting ready

---

## Migration Approach

### Strategy: Feature-by-Feature Migration

**NOT:**
- ❌ Copy-paste entire old app
- ❌ Rewrite everything at once
- ❌ "We'll refactor later"

**INSTEAD:**
- ✅ Migrate one feature at a time
- ✅ Refactor as we go
- ✅ Test each feature
- ✅ Document decisions

### Process for Each Feature

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Feature Migration Process             │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘

1. ANALYZE (Old App)
   ↓ Understand how feature currently works
   ↓ Document algorithm/logic
   ↓ Identify dependencies
   ↓ Note edge cases

2. DESIGN (New App)
   ↓ Plan component structure
   ↓ Design data flow
   ↓ Choose where it fits
   ↓ Consider reusing existing code

3. IMPLEMENT
   ↓ Follow coding-standards.md
   ↓ Follow react-standards.md
   ↓ Write TypeScript types first
   ↓ Add error handling
   ↓ Keep functions small

4. TEST
   ↓ Manual testing
   ↓ Write automated tests (if time)
   ↓ Test edge cases
   ↓ Compare with old behavior

5. DOCUMENT
   ↓ Update dev-docs
   ↓ Add code comments
   ↓ Note any differences
   ↓ Document decisions

6. COMMIT
   ↓ Conventional commit message
   ↓ Push to GitHub
   ↓ Update feature inventory
```

## ICE Scoring Framework

### What is ICE?

**ICE** = **I**mpact × **C**onfidence × **E**ase

Used to prioritize which features to migrate first.

### Scoring (1-10 scale)

**Impact (I):** How valuable is this feature?
- 10 = Critical core functionality
- 5 = Nice to have, moderate value
- 1 = Minor feature, rarely used

**Confidence (C):** How sure are you about the implementation?
- 10 = Fully understand, straightforward
- 5 = Some unknowns, moderate complexity
- 1 = Very uncertain, many unknowns

**Ease (E):** How easy is it to implement?
- 10 = Very simple, < 1 hour
- 5 = Moderate complexity, few hours
- 1 = Very complex, multiple days

### ICE Score Calculation

```
ICE Score = (Impact + Confidence + Ease) / 3
```

**Or weighted:**
```
ICE Score = (Impact × 2 + Confidence + Ease) / 4
```
(Weights Impact more heavily)

### Prioritization

```
ICE Score   Priority    Action
─────────────────────────────────
9.0 - 10.0  URGENT      Do immediately
7.0 - 8.9   HIGH        Do this week
5.0 - 6.9   MEDIUM      Do this month
3.0 - 4.9   LOW         Do eventually
0.0 - 2.9   DEFER       Consider not doing
```

## Feature-by-Feature Plan

### To Be Completed After Old App Analysis

**Template for Each Feature:**

```markdown
### Feature Name

**Description:** What does this feature do?

**Current Location (Old App):**
- File: App.tsx
- Lines: 123-456
- Dependencies: react-csv, lodash, etc.

**Complexity:** Simple / Medium / Complex

**ICE Scoring:**
- Impact: 8/10 (users love this feature)
- Confidence: 9/10 (straightforward to implement)
- Ease: 7/10 (few hours of work)
- **ICE Score: 8.0** (HIGH priority)

**Migration Plan:**
1. Extract logic from lines 123-456
2. Create new component: src/components/FeatureName.tsx
3. Add hook: src/hooks/useFeatureName.ts (if needed)
4. Add utilities: src/utils/featureUtils.ts (if needed)
5. Add to App.tsx
6. Test thoroughly

**Dependencies Needed:**
- Already have: chart.js, date-fns
- Need to add: none

**Estimated Time:** 3 hours

**Assigned To:** TBD

**Status:** Not Started / In Progress / Testing / Done

**Completion Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

**Notes:** Any special considerations
```

### Example Feature (Placeholder)

**This will be filled in after analyzing old app:**

```markdown
### CSV Upload & Parsing

**Description:** Allows users to upload CSV files with trade data

**ICE Score: 9.0** (URGENT)
- Impact: 10/10 (core functionality)
- Confidence: 9/10 (already have similar in new app)
- Ease: 8/10 (enhance existing)

**Status:** ✅ Already exists in new app!
**Location:** src/components/UploadSection.tsx

**Action:** Compare implementations, adopt best features from old app

[ ] Error messages are user-friendly
[ ] UI is responsive (mobile/desktop)
[ ] Performance is acceptable
[ ] Matches old app behavior (or better)
[ ] Edge cases handled
[ ] TypeScript types are correct
```

---

### Automated Testing (Future)

**Setup:**
```bash
npm install -D vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
```

**Test Structure:**
```typescript
// src/components/__tests__/FeatureName.test.tsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import { FeatureName } from '../FeatureName'

describe('FeatureName', () => {
  it('renders correctly', () => {
    render(<FeatureName />)
    expect(screen.getByText('Expected Text')).toBeInTheDocument()
  })

  it('handles user interaction', () => {
    // Test user flows
  })

  it('handles errors gracefully', () => {
    // Test error cases
  })
})
```

---

### Comparison Testing

**Create test data:**
1. Use same CSV files in both apps
2. Compare output metrics
3. Verify calculations match
4. Document any differences

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Numeric results match within 0.01% (floating point precision)
- UI displays same information
- User flows are preserved or improved

---

## Rollback Plan

### If Migration Goes Wrong

**Immediate Actions:**

1. **Stop the migration**
   - Don't merge to main branch
   - Keep work in feature branch

2. **Assess the issue**
   - What broke?
   - Why did it break?
   - Can we fix quickly?

3. **Rollback if needed**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git log  # Find last good commit
   git revert <commit-hash>
   ```

4. **Learn and document**
   - What went wrong?
   - How to prevent next time?
   - Update migration strategy

### Prevention

- Work in feature branches
- Small, incremental commits
- Test thoroughly before merging
- Keep old app running during migration
- Have backups

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Today)

1. **Analyze Old App** (20-30 min)
   ```bash
   # Open old app
   code "C:\Users\kg129\Desktop\5MF\Portfolio_Buddy\src\App.tsx"
   ```

2. **Create Feature Inventory** (30-40 min)
   - Document every feature
   - Assign ICE scores
   - Identify lines of code
   - Note dependencies

3. **Identify Top 5 Features** (10 min)
   - Sort by ICE score
   - Choose first migration candidate
   - Plan the migration

4. **Start First Migration** (This Week)
   - Pick highest ICE score
   - Follow migration process
   - Document lessons learned
